[x] pagination for main screen,
[x ] read from .json file


[ ] load names from .json file ._-> main screen buttons




#Pagination notes
# Race selection ._-> depth of 1
# Lore selection ._-> depth of 3


# Start off with blank page + go back button.
# Prob best to generate the pages for each race,
# Then "draw" the pages individually ??
# Can also just have a skeleton page that imports data from .json <<This seems easier to get off ground but may have
# issues>>
Create hop pages for when user clicks on race button
    - back button
    - confirm button
    - attributes section (+50% attack dam etc)
    - About section (You are a gnome text here rawrr)
    - base attributes section ( height, health )
    - race name
